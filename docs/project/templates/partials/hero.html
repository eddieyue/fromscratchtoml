            <LI>To minimise the use of external dependencies except the fundamental ones like numpy and matplotlib.
            <LI>To make sure that the algorithms are coherent with already existing machine learning frameworks.
            <LI>To be a one stop repository for understanding almost all the basic machine learning algorithms.
